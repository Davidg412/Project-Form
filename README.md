# Project: Sign-Up Form

This is "Project: Sign-up Form" from The Odin Project's full stack Javascript path, intermediate HTML and CSS section. The purpose of this project was to practice creating a form with the HTML form controls and various CSS concepts studied in the course. CSS Flexbox was used as the primary layout style to style this page and I was able to implement the use of psuedo-classes and psuedo-elements to make my form's style dynamic.

HTML Notes:
The important thing to remember with HTML forms is the connection between label and input elements. These elements allow us to collect data from the user's of our websites, that utimately get sent to the backend of our website (server).
